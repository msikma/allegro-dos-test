                 QNX-specific information.

         See readme.txt for a more general overview.



===================================
============ QNX notes ============
===================================

   Status: it works. Only annoying bug left seems to be the display switching
   in fullscreen mode; just don't try to change workspace while in fullscreen
   or your program will crash... Also, video bitmaps and hardware acceleration
   are still not yet implemented.



===========================================
============ Required software ============
===========================================

   The library works with QNX 6.0 RTP. You need the development tools
   installed on your system; if you don't have them, you can get them from the
   QNX online repository using the Package Manager.



============================================
============ Installing Allegro ============
============================================

   As Allegro is a multiplatform library, you first need to set it up for use
   on QNX RTP, by running:

      chmod +x fix.sh
      ./fix.sh qnx

   Now you may want to generate the dependencies; this step is optional if
   you are using an official release, but it is required if you got a SVN
   snapshot of the library.

      make depend

   Then you need to build Allegro:

      make

   And finally install it (you need to be root for this):

      su -c "make install"

   Installing the library will copy the header files to /usr/include, the
   library file to /usr/lib and the allegro-config script into /usr/bin.
   
   

=======================================
============ Using Allegro ============
=======================================

   Linking with Allegro requires you to link also other libraries to your
   executables. To avoid you having to work out the right linker commands for
   yourself, the installation creates a script, allegro-config, that will
   print out a suitable commandline. You can use this inside a backtick 
   command substitution, for example:

      gcc myfile.c -o myprogram `allegro-config --libs`

   Or if you want to build a debug version of your program, assuming that 
   you have installed the debug version of Allegro:

      gcc myfile.c -o myprogram `allegro-config --libs debug`

   Unix newbies, take note that these are ` backticks, not normal ' quotes!

   There are also switches for printing out the Allegro version number and
   overriding the install paths. Run allegro-config without any arguments
   for a full list of options.

   Don't forget that you need to use the END_OF_MAIN() macro right after
   your main() function!



=====================================
============ Final notes ============
=====================================

   Allegro for QNX requires you to be running the Photon MicroGUI environment;
   if Photon cannot be found, the library will fail to initialize. If this
   happens, you're probably in a text console; just run "ph" to start Photon.
