                Watcom-specific information.

         See readme.txt for a more general overview.



======================================
============ Watcom notes ============
======================================

   Status: complete and fully functional, but not so widely used and tested 
   as the djgpp code. This version is heavily based on the djgpp version, 
   basically just emulating whatever parts of the djgpp libc aren't provided 
   by Watcom. See docs/build/djgpp.txt for information about the available
   hardware drivers: the djgpp and Watcom versions are 100% identical in this
   respect.

   This library works with version 10.6 and the various 11.0 versions of the
   Watcom C compiler, as well as with Open Watcom 1.0 or later.



===========================================
============ Required software ============
===========================================

   Watcom C version 10.6 or 11.0x, or Open Watcom 1.0 or later.
   djgpp compiler (djdev*.zip, gcc*b.zip, and bnu*b.zip).
   GNU make (mak*b.zip).
   GNU sed (sed*b.zip):
      Required for 10.6: Used to build asm sources.
      Optional for other versions: Used by "make depend".
   
   Except for the Watcom compiler itself, all of the above packages can be 
   downloaded from your nearest SimTel mirror site, in the 
   /pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/ directory, or you can use the zip picker on
   http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/. See the djgpp readme.1st file for
   information about how to install djgpp.



============================================
============ Installing Allegro ============
============================================

   This is a source-only distribution, so you will have to compile Allegro 
   before you can use it. To do this you should:

   Type "cd allegro", followed by "fix.bat watcom", followed by "make". Then
   go do something interesting while everything compiles. When it finishes 
   compiling, type "make install" to set the library up ready for use.

   The makefile will try to guess whether you are using Watcom 10.6 or 11.0 
   by checking for the presence of wdisasm.exe. If it gets this wrong, you
   may need to override it by passing WATCOM_VERSION=10.6 or
   WATCOM_VERSION=11 as arguments to make, or setting the WATCOM_VERSION
   environment variable.

   If you also want to install a debugging version of the library (highly 
   recommended), now type "make install DEBUGMODE=1". Case is important, so
   it must be DEBUGMODE, not debugmode!

   If you also want to install a profiling version of the library, now type 
   "make install PROFILEMODE=1".

   If your copy of Allegro doesn't include the makefile.dep dependency files
   (unlikely, unless you have run "make veryclean" at some point), you can
   regenerate them by running "make depend".



=======================================
============ Using Allegro ============
=======================================

   All the Allegro functions, variables, and data structures are defined in 
   allegro.h. You should include this in your programs, and link with either
   the optimised library alleg.lib, the debugging library alld.lib, or the
   profiling library allp.lib. Programs that use Allegro must be compiled to
   use the stack based calling convention (wcl386 option '-5s'), and with
   stack overflow checks disabled (wcl386 option '-s'). You will also have
   to increase the stack size from the miserly Watcom default, using a 
   wcl386 option like '-k128k', or a linker command like 'option stack=128k'.
